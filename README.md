# Codex-Fanfiction

This is a copy of the "Codex Fanfiction Reader" app, formerly release on the Play Store. It's mostly here for posterity's sake.

## Building

By default the build requires [Splunk Mint](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MintAndroidSDK/5.2.x/DevGuide/Requirementsandinstallation#Use_the_Android_SDK_with_MINT_instrumentation), though it's not used in any meaningful way and any other telemetry infrastructure could be used.

## Known Issues

There is no proper support for some changes made in Android 6.0+, so the current state of the app is likely very buggy.
